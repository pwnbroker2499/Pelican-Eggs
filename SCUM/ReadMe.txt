you'll need to open 3 ports. (target, target+1, target+2) i.e. if port=1000, you'll need to unblock/allocate 1000, 1001, and 1002 [UDP]. RCON on target TCP
(conflicting storries on this. may only be the 2 greater port. i.e. 1000 and 1002)

I don't know the startp commands yet so you'll have to configure the ServerSettings.ini directly outside of port (They just added https://scum.fandom.com/wiki/Scum_Dedicated_server_setup have yet to read it)

This egg is started based around the server files distributed 6/18/25 before steam had a chance to host them. Download the files from https://mega.nz/file/PRkigKCJ#07f8lVo0rcPjQrmn9vZXelOu-IC4botq2fTfSeoUiXA and extract the contents to the SCUMSever folder created on install.
I will likely update this when the steam version goes live
