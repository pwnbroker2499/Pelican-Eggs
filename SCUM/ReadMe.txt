you'll need to open the port that's 2 higer than your chosen port. i.e. if port=1000 you'll connect on 1002 so you need to unblock 1000 and 1002

I don't know the startp commands yet so you'll have to configure the ServerSettings.ini directly outside of port

This egg is started based around the server files distributed 6/18/25 before steam had a chance to host them. Download the files from https://mega.nz/file/PRkigKCJ#07f8lVo0rcPjQrmn9vZXelOu-IC4botq2fTfSeoUiXA and extract the contents to SCUMSever I will likely update this when the steam version goes live
